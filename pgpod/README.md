# Notes

## Feb 17, 2023

* Got a basic postgres container setup working
* Bringing it up as "kube" unit works using extra secret

Stage 2: using volume for dbinit

* This is not working yet. Working out how to read pod logs but that may not be possible per https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/17502
